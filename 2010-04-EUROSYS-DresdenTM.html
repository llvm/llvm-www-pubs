<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
AMD's Advanced Synchronization Facility (ASF) is an x86 instruction set
extension proposal intended to simplify and speed up the
synchronization of concurrent programs. In this paper, we report our
experiences using ASF for implementing transactional memory. We have extended
a C/C++ compiler to support language-level transactions and generate
code that takes advantage of ASF. We use a software fallback mechanism for
transactions that cannot be committed within ASF (e.g., because of hardware 
capacity limitations).  Our evaluation uses a cycle-accurate x86 simulator 
that we have extended with ASF support. Building a complete ASF-based software 
stack allows us to evaluate the performance gains that a user-level program 
can obtain from ASF. Our measurements on a wide range of benchmarks indicate 
that the overheads traditionally associated with software transactional 
memories can be significantly reduced with the help of ASF.
